## Your Rights

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)


Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to:

1. Request that a business that collects a consumer's personal data disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.
  - We believe that this document complies with (1). If you disagree, please contact us.
2. Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data
  - We do not sell your personal data.
3. Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected within a month of the request
  - You may request that your personal data be deleted through your account settings by deleting your account. Any other form of request will not guarantee a response within a month.
  - Some data may not be possible to delete, such as but not limited to aggregated data that does not identify you personally, and data that we are required to keep by law.

We believe that those consumer protections are positive, and extend them to all users, not just those in California.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Under the GDPR, among other rights, European Union residents have the right to:

1. Access: You have the right to request copies of your personal data.
  - You may request a copy of your personal data, free of charge, through your account settings. No other form of request will guarantee a response.
  - Some data may not be possible to access, such as but not limited to aggregated data that does not identify you personally.
2. Rectification: You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request that we complete the information you believe is incomplete.
  - You may correct or complete your personal data through your account settings. No other form of request will guarantee a response.
  - Not all data may be possible to correct or complete, such as but not limited to user IDs, aggregated data that does not identify you personally, and data that we are required to keep by law.
3. Erasure: You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.
  - You may request that your personal data be deleted through your account settings by deleting your account. Any other form of request will not guarantee a response.
  - Some data may not be possible to delete, such as but not limited to aggregated data that does not identify you personally, and data that we are required to keep by law.
4. Restrict Processing: You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
  - You may restrict the processing of your personal data by deleting your account. Due to the nature of databases, your data will be processed for as long as it is stored. Any other form of request will not guarantee a response.
  - Some data may not be possible to restrict processing of, such as but not limited to aggregated data that does not identify you personally, and data that we are required to keep by law.
5. Object to Processing: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
  - Please contact us to object to the processing of your personal data.
6. Data Portability: You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.
  - You may send a copy of your personal data to yourself through your account settings, which you may then transfer to another organization. No other form of request will guarantee a response.
  - Some data may not be possible to transfer, such as but not limited to aggregated data that does not identify you personally.

Again, we believe that those consumer protections are positive, and extend them to all users, not just those in the European Union.

### Children's Information

While we believe that children should have the right to use and interact with the internet, we also recognize that they also represent a vulnerable population. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. Please contact us if you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided this kind of information on our website, and we will try to remove such information from our records.
